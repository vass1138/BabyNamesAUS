More baby names.  First up, all the cousins.  All post-2000 babies.  Lola, Angus, and Ruby (!!!) peaking in this period.  Anthony, Thomas, and Josephine trending down.   Alethea and  Colton keeping it real.
Parents next!
(I used the SA data as it was most accessible.  The data is not standardised across states.  Every state provides information differently, if at all.  From the brief view of the other states I could manage, I did not see any major difference in curve shapes.)
