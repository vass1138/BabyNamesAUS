Latest data project following last week's AFL grand final:  Do certain baby names become more popular a year after a grand final win, aka "The Dusty Effect".
I've gathered recent popular baby names in Victoria and matched them with player names from premiership teams.  Years shown are birth years.  Premiership teams shown are from the previous year.
- Interesting to see that some names become LESS popular after a premiership.  Maybe people really hate these teams?
- Collingwood supporters seem to be lacking imagination with only two names matching.
- Sydney had a strong showing with Lewis and Jude:  names did not even appear in previous year's list.  Same for Elliot in 2019, although  why there would be an increase for a West Coast name in Victoria beats me.
- Hawthorn supporters got their act together by 2016 with all positive gains, although it took them three years to get it right.  The Bulldogs did it in one year.
As to The Dusty Effect?  Baby names for 2020 have not been released yet (doh!).  With Richmond winning 2019 and 2020, we still could see a Dusty surge in the next few years.
Have a great weekend everyone.
